# Ansible Requirements Updater

**Update your requirements.yml with this grisly Ansible playbook.**

This is one of the gookiest Ansible playbooks I've ever written.

But it does something I need, and it's a lot faster than doing it manually, and I do it every few months. So it was worth spending two hours automating the process on a Friday night while watching a Blues game.

The playbook does the following:

  1. Reads in a list of role requirements from an existing `requirements.yml` file (at `requirements_file_path`).
  2. Loops through all the roles in that list, and gets the latest role version string from Ansible Galaxy.
  3. Generates a new requirements list.
  4. Writes the new list to the `requirements.yml` file.

If you're really daring and had a few drinks, you can set `requirements_file_backup` to `false`, and overwrite your artisinally-handcrafted requirements file with whatever this playbook disgorges ü§Æ.

You might be wondering at this point: "Why doesn't geerlingguy just run `ansible-galaxy update -r requirements.yml`?" Well, unfortunately, [`update` is not a thing](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/issues/1358), and might never be, for roles on Ansible Galaxy. Collections _might_ someday get that functionality (so we can stop updating our `requirements.yml` files by hand like neanderthals), but until then, you can do it manually, or trust your life to this playbook. I know what _I'd_ do.

## Caveats

  - This has only been tested with `geerlingguy.*` roles, and a few others which follow semantic versioning standards. Since Galaxy allows practically anything as a version (heck, you could probably throw a ü¶ë in there and it would work), the playbook will likely break your requirements in new and interesting ways if you use roles that do strange things with versioning.
  - This playbook only handles requirements files with `roles` in them, not with `roles` and `collections`. If you have any `collections` listed in your requirements file, this playbook will act like they don't exist and they will go üí•.
    - Maybe this playbook will support collections someday, maybe not. Buy my book and I'll be at least 0.0002% more likely to fix [issue #1](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-requirements-updater/issues/1).
  - You should never write a playbook like this. It is dumb. It is inefficient. It is against every one of the best practices I espouse in my book [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com) and my blog posts on Ansible. But I did, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Usage

Let's assume you have a requirements file (`requirements.yml`) with contents like:

```yaml
---
roles:
  - name: geerlingguy.ansible
    version: 1.2.0
  - name: geerlingguy.certbot
    version: 3.0.0
  - name: geerlingguy.docker
    version: 2.1.0
```

Run the playbook like so:

    ansible-playbook main.yml -e "requirements_file_path=path/to/a/requirements.yml"

Go get a coffee (‚òïÔ∏è) ‚Äì it's going to take a while because of how horrifically inefficient it is to use Ansible as a programming language like this playbook does.

Cross your fingers (ü§û) and hope it works.

> **Note**: It is _highly_ recommended you track your `requirements.yml` file in a git repository. That way if this playbook mangles it horrifically, you can `git restore requirements.yml` and act like nothing happened ü§ê.
>
> If you're feeling particularly daring ü¶π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, add `-e "requirements_file_backup=false"` to overwrite the file without creating a backup.
